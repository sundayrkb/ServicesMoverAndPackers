Services Mover & Packers - Ready-to-upload site
---------------------------------------------

Files included:
- index.html
- css/styles.css
- js/main.js
- sitemap.xml
- robots.txt
- CNAME (contains 'servicesmover.tk' by default)

IMPORTANT:
1) Do NOT upload the ZIP file directly to GitHub -- extract it first.
2) Edit index.html before upload to replace placeholders:
   - Replace +91-XXXXXXXXXX with your phone number (search for '+91-XXXXXXXXXX').
   - Replace info@servicesmover.tk if you want another email (search for 'info@servicesmover.tk').
   - If you don't have the freenom domain yet, delete or edit the 'CNAME' file before enabling GitHub Pages.

Quick steps to publish on GitHub (web UI):
1. Create a new repo named: username.github.io  (replace username with your GitHub username)
2. Open the repo, click 'Add file' -> 'Upload files'
3. Drag & drop the extracted site files/folders (index.html, css/, js/, sitemap.xml, robots.txt, CNAME)
4. Commit changes
5. Go to Settings -> Pages -> Source -> choose 'main' branch and '/ (root)' -> Save
6. Your site will be available at: https://username.github.io/
   (If using a custom domain, point DNS and keep the CNAME file)

If you'd like, I can walk you through:
- Creating the GitHub repo and uploading step-by-step (I'll tell you what to click).
- Registering a free domain at Freenom and pointing DNS.
- Setting up Zoho Mail for info@servicesmover.tk.
- Final SEO checks and submitting sitemap to Google Search Console.
